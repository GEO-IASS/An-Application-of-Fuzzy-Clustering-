An-Application-of-Fuzzy-Clustering-
===================================

This project is a survey of fuzzy set theory applied in cluster analysis. These fuzzy clustering algorithms have been widely studied and applied in a variety of substantive areas. it is  one of the fuzzy clustering techniques based on objective function. Cluster analysis is one of the major techniques in pattern recognition. The importance of clustering is well appreciated in various areas such as engineering systems and image processing. The conventional clustering methods restrict that each point of the data set belongs to exactly one cluster. Fuzzy set theory gives an idea of uncertainty of belonging, which was described by a membership function. The use of fuzzy sets provides imprecise class membership information.  The purpose of this project is briefly to survey the fuzzy set theory applied in cluster analysis.
